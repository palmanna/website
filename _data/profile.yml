 I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation (ILLC)</a> at the University of Amsterdam. As part of the research consortium <a href="https://language-science.nl/" target="_blank">Language Sciences for Social Good</a> I am investigating multimodal communication in people with auditory impairments. For this, I am using kinematic analyses combined with speech analyses of naturalistic dialogues as well as EEG.
