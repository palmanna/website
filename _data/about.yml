short_bio: |
   I am curious, critical, and genuinely interested in humans and their stories and have the chance to tell those in the street newspaper <a href="https://oew.org/zebra/" target="_blank">zebra.</a>.

   Whenever I have time, I enjoy exploring the world with my bicycle and by foot on long-distance travels. Before starting my PhD I did a solo-cycling trip from Austria to Kenya, where I explored different landscapes and cultures, and followed one of my passions: learning languages (currently I'm busy learning Hebrew and Arabic). 
  
   Finally, I care about good food and sustainability and am therefore involved in various cooking projects aiming to reduce food waste, and in a community-supported agriculture project.
