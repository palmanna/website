short_bio: |
   I am curious, critical, and genuinely interested in humans and their stories and have the chance to tell those in the street newspaper <a href="https://oew.org/zebra/" target="_blank">zebra.</a>.

   Whenever I have time, I enjoy exploring the world with my bicycle and by foot on long-distance travels (before starting my current position I did a solo-cycling trip from Austria to Armenia and then to Kenya). This presented a great opportunity for me to get a glimpse into different landscapes and cultures, and to follow one of my passions: learning new languages. 
   
   Finally, I care about good food and sustainability and am therefore involved in various cooking projects aiming to reduce food waste, as well as in a community-supported agriculture project.
