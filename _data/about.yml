short_bio: >
   I am curious, critical, and genuinely interested in humans and their stories. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the world with my bicycle and by foot on long-distance hikes. This presents a great opportunity for me to get a glimpse into different landscapes and cultures, and to follow one of my passions: learning new languages. Besides that, I care about good food and am involved in various cooking projects aiming to reduce food waste and I am part of a community-supported agriculture project. Finally, I also am a freelance journalist for the street newspaper <a href="https://oew.org/zebra/" target="_blank">zebra.</a>.
