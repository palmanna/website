   I have always been interested in the intersection of language and cognition.

   For my master's theses I researched linguistic humor as well as audiovisual integration of speech, using methods from computational linguistics and fMRI.

   In my I am researching multimodal communication in challenging listening conditions. I am investigating acoustic and linguistic features of speech as well as kinematic features
   of gestures, head movements, facial expressions, and body posture using a data-driven machine learning approach. My target group are individuals who are hard-of-hearing and in 
   lab experiments, they will engage in free- and task-based naturalistic dialogue. 

   With this research, we hope to provide insights into how to make communication easier and more successful for hard-of-hearing individuals, especially in noisy contexts.
